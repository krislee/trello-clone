## Project Description

For our unit03 project, we are creating a clone of the popular productivity app [Trello](https://trello.com/). Users sign up and login with a custom username and password and then are taken to a mobile, tablet, and desktop application where they can add a board. In each board, they can add a card that holds a list of items tied to the specified card. Each user utilizes CRUD (i.e. create, read, update, and delete) functionality to manipulate each card and/or board on a backend server created and maintained by Ruby on Rails and SQL. 

## Google Sheet

Include link to your google sheet here.  Here is the sample [Suresh had used in class](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V1M3Eq1NXH2PNmeTlVviRhEjX9kenq769Vo2P5mMtro/edit#gid=0) 

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.  

- [Wireframe] (https://res.cloudinary.com/dhiwn0i0g/image/upload/v1598061926/Screen_Shot_2020-08-21_at_10.04.40_PM_zs3paq.png)


## Time/Priority Matrix 

Include a full list of features that have been [prioritized](https://res.cloudinary.com/doaftkgbv/image/upload/v1583773146/ValueVSComplexity_u2inhx.png) based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.  This involves drawing a a square.  In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line.  The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs.  This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete. 

Now draw a vertical line on the y axis.  The top of this line should have `High` and the bottom `Low`.  This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.  

Now create a separate list starting with A and assign it one of the features.  Continue to assign each feature a letter.  Once complete add each letter to the matrix assigning based on what your feel it's prioirty is an how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 2hrs to complete than break it down into smaller tasks and reassign them a new letter. 

Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo. 

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

#### MVP

- Proper authentication and authorization for login
- Make model and migration files for user, board, and items
- Create relevant CRUD functionalities for user, board, and items through controllers/routes
- Test all routes for proper functionality
- Deploy to Heroku

#### PostMVP 

- Add model and migration file for activity log
- Create additional table for team

| Deployment | H | -hr | -hr | -hr|
| Create Seed Data for Initial Users, Boards, and Items | M | -hr | -hr |
| Board Controllers | H | -hr| -hr |
| Item Controllers | H | -hr | -hr |
| Test Controller Merge/Pull Requests | H | -hrs| -hr |
| Total | - | -hrs| -hrs |

#### PostMVP
